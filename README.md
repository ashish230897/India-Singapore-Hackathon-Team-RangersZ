# Shared Digital Identity Verification  

This project is a part of the first ever **India Singapore Hackathon** that took place in *November, 2018*. The hackathon was held in the **Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.**
It was a great initiative and effort by **All India Council For Technical Education (AICTE) and our Honorable Prime Minister to bring together the teams from both the countries to work on problems common to both the nations and also the whole globe.**  

We made a prototype for **'Shared Digital Identity Verification' using Blockchain(Hyperledger Fabric) and Facial Recognition.** Blockchain provides with *immutability* as the major feature along with *decentralisation* and *facial recognition* helped us to *uniquely* identify individuals. This can be used to *decentralise* the identity of an individual for mega events(e.g [college festivals or large concerts]) and serves various advantages.  

The project is divided into four parts out of which we have included only three parts into this repository. The three parts are :  
* The user android App  
* The Flask Server  
* The Hyperledger business network.

**As the image workflow describes, all the user information is linked to the user in the blockchain database. This is possible with the help of the user's face which is his unique identity!**
